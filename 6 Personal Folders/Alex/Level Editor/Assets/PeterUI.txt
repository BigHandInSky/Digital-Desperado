OpenFolder
	- FolderSelectUI - this controls what to activate/deactivate, as well as when opening, starting the list manager
		- UIBlock - stops UI clicking
		- MainPanel - the general bg to all the cool stuff
		- Texts - white font
		- Cancel - has script which when the ui opens, dictates whether this can be interacted with/not
			/ eg in the main game, if MenusXML has no urls, you can't exit out of folder select
		- Select - same as cancel, except this has a coroutine checking each frame whether it is selectable
			/ eg in main game, if the folder selected has no xml files in it, then this cannot be interacted with
			/ currently the list manager handles checking, and this reads the resulting bool
		- SystemFolders - Handles getting the current directory, displaying files/folders from it, and changing directory
			/ this is the core of the ui
			/ to change to files, look at FillList and FolderSelectEntry's script, switch from looking for directories to Files + FileInfos
			- scroll rect master - the scroll rect
				- scrollcontent - this is where the buttons for the files go
					(- FolderSelectEntry - a button given a directoryInfo, which displays FullName from the given info
						/ when the button is pressed it calls SystemFolders to load the DirectoryInfo on this button)
		- CurrentUrl - linked to SystemFolder, just displays a given string
		- Scroller - scroll bar for SystemFolders
			-/
				-/
		- UpFolder - calls a function from SystemFolders to move to the parent of the current directory

Editor:
	- Popup Canvas is in Sort order 1, Main in 0, so as UIBlocker can do it's job
	- Popup's UI blocker will stop the user from clicking on any of the UI behind it
	- So when either button is clicked or the function finished, SetActive(false) the popup canvas
	- For tooltip, Inputfields are provided, and it is set to scale from the bottom right
	- Placed under an empty parent, so enable/disable that to show/hide it
	- As well as this is Tooltip space, which has text explaining how to make it appear, switch between the two for added polish
	- Name text has support for around 22 characters, switching resolutions in the game view takes off 1/2 characters
	- I have set the buttons around the background to the name text to anchor from it, so you can expand this without worry if need be
	- other than that should be self-explanatory as to what does what
